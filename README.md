# demo-project

## Prerequisites

- this SPA demonstrates my implementation of a [Testtask](TASK.md)

- vuex is used for state-management and a http-client has been implemented

- api-endpoints exist for the environments mock and live. A switch between the both is possible using the env-var `VUE_APP_API_CLIENT` but is not used, because there is no actual backend.

## Observations

### form builder

- Use drag and drop toolbar for adding and removing items from the form. This could also be accomplished by buttons

## Improvements

- the ui is clearly a subject to improve

- styles can be centralized in the style-plugin
